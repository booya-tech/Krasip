# Tests explained

Every automated test, in plain English. Tests live in `Packages/KrasipKit/Tests` and use Swift Testing (`@Test`, `#expect`).

Run them with `swift test` inside `Packages/KrasipKit`, or ⌘U in Xcode.

## KrasipCoreTests — the logic (no microphone, no network)

### AcceptanceTests.swift — the spec's acceptance table

| Test | What it checks |
| --- | --- |
| `primarySuccessCase` | "…ไปทำ side project" becomes "…ไปทำ side-project", and the only change listed is `side project -> side-project (glossary)`. |
| `englishTermsStayUntouched` | "เดี๋ยว push code ขึ้น GitHub" comes out exactly the same, with no changes. |
| `spokenTimeBecomesDigits` | "…ตอน ten AM" becomes "…ตอน 10 AM", explained as a spoken-time change. |
| `pullRequestStaysUntouched` | "ส่ง pull request ให้ทีม" comes out exactly the same. |
| `thaiAliasUsesGlossaryWhenSaved` | With the side-project entry saved, "ทำไซต์โปรเจกต์" becomes "ทำ side-project". |
| `thaiAliasStaysWithoutGlossary` | Without that entry, "ทำไซต์โปรเจกต์" is left alone — no rule, no change. |
| `similarSoundingPhraseIsNotReplaced` | "ไซต์งาน" (a work site) is not replaced just because it starts like the alias. |
| `acceptanceCasesAreStableAcrossRuns` | Runs the key cases 20 times to prove the result never varies ("pass consistently"). |

### TextPolicyTests.swift — the cleanup rules

| Test | What it checks |
| --- | --- |
| `collapsesRepeatedWhitespaceAndTrims` | Tabs and double spaces become single spaces; the ends are trimmed; only "cleanup" changes are listed. |
| `removesZeroWidthCharacters` | Invisible zero-width characters are removed. |
| `composesUnicodeToNFC` | Decomposed accents are composed, so text looks and compares the same. |
| `keepsThaiCharactersExactly` | A plain Thai sentence is returned character for character. |
| `emptyTranscriptStaysEmpty` | Only spaces in → empty text out, no crash. |
| `insertsSpaceBetweenThaiAndEnglish` | "ส่งpull requestให้ทีม" gets a space on each side of the English. |
| `insertsSpaceBetweenThaiAndDigits` | "ตอน10 AM" becomes "ตอน 10 AM". |
| `undoingSpacingKeepsTheTextJoined` | Undoing the spacing rule leaves Thai and English joined, as heard. |
| `existingSpaceIsNotDuplicated` | A space that is already there is not doubled. |
| `urlsAreNotBrokenBySpacingOrGlossary` | A URL next to Thai text is spaced from it but never changed inside, even when an alias ("github") appears in it. |
| `emailsAreProtected` | An alias inside an email address is not replaced. |
| `codeFragmentsAreProtectedFromPunctuationRemoval` | `config.json` and `fetchUser()` keep their dots and brackets when punctuation removal is on. |
| `numbersAreProtected` | "2,500" and "3.5%" keep their punctuation. |
| `englishIsNeverTransliteratedOrChangedWithoutARule` | With an empty glossary, every English word in a mixed sentence comes out unchanged. |
| `glossaryOutputIsNotReplacedAgain` | After "side project" becomes "side-project", a second rule for "project" cannot change it again. |
| `keepModeLeavesPunctuation` | The default punctuation mode leaves a final period alone. |
| `noTrailingPeriodModeDropsFinalPeriodOnly` | "Drop the final period" removes only the last period. |
| `noTrailingPeriodKeepsEllipsis` | "…" at the end is not treated as a period. |
| `noneModeRemovesSentencePunctuation` | "Remove punctuation" removes commas and exclamation marks. |
| `suggestModeDoesNotChangeTextButReportsSuggestion` | An "Ask me first" entry leaves the text unchanged but reports where the suggestion is. |
| `acceptingASuggestionAppliesIt` | Once accepted, that suggestion is applied. |
| `disabledEntryNeverReplaces` | An entry set to "Off" never replaces or suggests. |
| `undoingAGlossaryChangeRestoresTheTranscript` | Undoing a glossary change gives back what was heard. |
| `undoingSpokenTimeKeepsWords` | Undoing the time rule keeps "ten AM" as words. |
| `glossaryRangesPointAtOutputs` | The highlight ranges point exactly at "side-project" in the final text. |
| `finalizingTwiceChangesNothingMore` | Running the policy on its own output changes nothing more (seven sample sentences). |
| `everyChangeIsExplainedInSpecFormat` | A sentence with a glossary word, a time, and spacing lists all four changes in `before -> after (kind)` form. |

### SpokenTimeTests.swift — "ten AM" → "10 AM"

| Test | What it checks |
| --- | --- |
| `convertsClockTimes` | Nine spoken forms: AM/PM in any case, "a.m.", "o'clock", "nine thirty", "six oh five", "eleven forty-five", and no space after Thai. |
| `leavesOtherNumbersAlone` | "two meetings", "ten people", "at nine", and "10 AM" are not touched. |

### SpokenSymbolTests.swift: the spoken name of a symbol becomes the symbol

Every recorded input is verbatim raw output from the speech model on a real recording. The table decides which names count, so these tests only ever check the text that comes out and the change that was logged.

Most symbols sit flush against one word, `ว้าว เครื่องหมายตกใจ` to `ว้าว!`. The four that sit between two things, `=`, `&`, `*`, and `#` said as `เครื่องหมายชาร์ป`, stand on their own instead and get one space on each side, so `hex เครื่องหมายเท่ากับ 10` becomes `hex = 10` and not `hex= 10`. The hashtag `#`, the bare `แหซทัก`, is a different row and still binds to the word after it.

`hash` is the name of `#` and an ordinary English word at the same time, so that row carries a list of words that must not follow it. A developer saying `hash map`, `hash table`, or `hash function` gets the words back untouched, while `hash the map` still gets the symbol, because only the word immediately after the name is checked. The preferred spelling of those phrases is a glossary job instead: `Hashmap`, `hash table`, and `hash function` are offered in the starter terms, and the glossary runs first and protects what it writes, so the rule never sees a phrase the user has saved.

A count word in front of the name repeats the symbol, so `double hash tag` is `##` and `triple hash tag` is `###`. It sits between the `เครื่องหมาย` prefix and the name, which is how the phrase is said: `เครื่องหมายดับเบิลโคลอน`. Only `double`, `triple`, and their Thai spellings count. The Thai `สอง` is left out on purpose, because it is an everyday number word and no recording shows how the model writes it in front of a symbol name.

| Test | What it checks |
| --- | --- |
| `writesTheSymbolTheUserSpoke` | The eleven recorded sentences, with their spacing: `เครื่องหมายตกใจ` to `!`, `hashtag` to `#`, `100 ดอลลาร์` to `$100`, the two brackets, `colon`, `semicolon`, `แห่ง` to `&`, `ดอกจัน` to `*`, `เท่ากับ` to `=`, and `hash sign` in an all-English sentence. |
| `keepsOneSpaceOnEachSideOfAStandaloneSymbol` | A standalone symbol at the very start or the very end of the text gets no space on the outside, a line break next to it counts as a separator already, text with a space on one side only ends with exactly one on each side, and no output ever holds two spaces in a row. |
| `aStandaloneSymbolSwallowsNoSpace` | The logged change for `hex เครื่องหมายเท่ากับ 10` is the phrase alone becoming `=`, leaving the spaces that were already there, and the one for `ดูที่เครื่องหมายดอกจันท้ายประโยค` carries the two new spaces with the symbol. |
| `logsEverySymbolAsAChange` | Each of those sentences logs a `spoken symbol` change whose before is a piece of the raw text and whose after is in the final text. |
| `logsTheSpokenPhraseAndTheSymbolItBecame` | The logged change for `ว้าว เครื่องหมายตกใจ` is the space plus the whole phrase turning into `!`, which is what the undo button reverses. |
| `logsBothBracketsOfOneSentence` | One sentence with two symbols logs two changes, in the order they were said. |
| `movesTheCurrencySymbolInFrontOfTheNumber` | `100 ดอลลาร์` is logged as one change covering the number too, because `$` moves in front of it. |
| `leavesTextWithoutASpokenSymbolAlone` | `sharp` without a marker, `ดอลล่า` with no number in front, the mangled `colon ใส่`, a URL and an email holding table names, and `android` and `hashed` all come through byte-identical with no change logged. |
| `bareNameNeedsNoMarkerButAMarkerNameDoes` | `hash` alone is enough and keeps its hashtag spacing; `sharp` needs `เครื่องหมาย` before it and then stands on its own. |
| `currencyNeedsDigitsInFront` | `20 dollars` becomes `$20`; the same word with no number stays a word. |
| `theEnglishSuffixIsIgnoredInAThaiSentence` | The `sign` suffix is only honoured when nothing in the text is Thai, because in a Thai sentence the model turns `colon sign` into `colon ใส่`. |
| `protectedSpansKeepTheirSymbolNames` | A URL, an email, and a backtick code fragment holding `hash`, `and`, or `colon` are untouched. |
| `aColonBetweenDigitsStaysATime` | The Thai time rule claims its colon first, so `บ่ายสองครึ่ง` is still `14:30` even next to a spoken colon. |
| `theUserCanUndoTheWholeRule` | Undoing the change turns the rule off and the raw text comes back. |
| `runningThePolicyAgainChangesNothingFurther` | Finalizing the output of all eleven sentences, all seven spacing cases, and all eight spaced-name and count cases again changes nothing, so inserting a space never pushes the text further. |
| `theSymbolIsProtectedFromLaterRules` | The new piece of text is marked protected, so spacing and punctuation leave the symbol alone. |
| `theLongerSpellingOfANameWins` | `ดอกจันทน์` is not read as `ดอกจัน` plus a leftover tail, `hashtag` wins over `hash`, and the spaced `hash tag` wins over `hash` so no `tag` is left stranded. |
| `writesASpacedNameAndRepeatsForACountWord` | `hash tag` and `แฮช แท็ก` said as two words give one `#`, and a count word in front repeats it: `double hash tag` to `##`, `triple hash tag` to `###`, `double colon sign` to `::`, `เครื่องหมายดับเบิลโคลอน` to `::`. |
| `logsTheCountWordAsPartOfThePhrase` | The count word is inside the logged change, so undo puts `double hash tag` back whole instead of leaving `double` behind. |
| `leavesAnOrdinaryHashPhraseAlone` | `hash map`, `hash function`, `hash table`, `hash join`, `hash key`, `hash value`, `hash collision`, and an already written `Hashmap` all come through byte-identical with no change logged. |
| `onlyTheWordRightAfterTheNameCanBlockTheSymbol` | `hash the map` still becomes `#the map`, because `map` is not the next word, and `HASH MAP` is blocked too, so the list ignores case. |
| `aNameAtTheEndOfTheTextStillBecomesTheSymbol` | `hash` with nothing after it is still `#`, so the missing next word is not treated as a blocked one. |
| `aCountWordWithNoSymbolNameIsLeftAlone` | `double trouble` and `ดับเบิลเบอร์เกอร์` are untouched, because a count word only counts in front of a name. |
| `aGlossaryEntryClaimsThePhraseBeforeTheRuleRuns` | With the starter `Hashmap` entry saved, `ใช้ hash map เก็บค่า` becomes `ใช้ Hashmap เก็บค่า` and no spoken-symbol change is logged at all. |
| `withNoGlossaryEntryThePhraseStaysAsSpoken` | With an empty glossary the same sentence stays `ใช้ hash map เก็บค่า`, so the rule protects itself and does not lean on the glossary. |

### ThaiSpokenTimeTests.swift: Thai times as people type them

Follows `docs/THAI_TIME_RULES.md`. There is no setting, so every test runs the standard style.

| Test | What it checks |
| --- | --- |
| `keepsWholeHoursAsSpokenWithDigits` | A whole hour keeps its words with the number as a digit: `หกโมงเย็น` to `6 โมงเย็น`, `บ่ายสอง` to `บ่าย 2`, `ตีห้า` to `ตี 5`. `เที่ยง`, `บ่ายโมง`, `ทุ่มนึง`, and `เที่ยงคืน` stay as they are, and a space the speech model put inside the time is removed. |
| `writesAClockForAClearHourWithMinutes` | An hour with minutes becomes the 24-hour clock with a leading zero: `บ่ายสองครึ่ง` to `14:30`, `ห้าโมงครึ่ง` to `17:30`, `ตีสองครึ่ง` to `02:30`, and the old way of counting, `สี่โมงเช้าครึ่ง` to `10:30`. |
| `writesAClockForAnHourSaidTheTwentyFourHourWay` | `สิบสี่โมง`, `14 โมง`, and `สิบแปดนาฬิกา` always become a clock, also without minutes. |
| `leavesAnUnclearHourSpokenWithoutAPeriodWord` | `หกโมงครึ่ง` can be morning or evening, so it becomes `6 โมงครึ่ง`, never a guessed clock. `เย็น` meaning cold, or a period word too far back, does not decide it. |
| `usesAPeriodWordJustBeforeTheHour` | `เช้า` or `เย็น` just before the hour decides it: `ตอนเช้าหกโมงครึ่ง` to `ตอนเช้า 06:30`, `เย็นนี้เจอกันหกโมงครึ่ง` to `18:30`. A whole hour still stays spoken. |
| `keepsClearHoursAsTheyWere` | A clear hour keeps its meaning whatever word comes before: `เจ็ดโมงครึ่ง` after `ตอนเช้า` is still 07:30. |
| `doesNotReadOtherWordsAsMinutes` | A count (`สิบคน`, `20 บาท`), a word that starts the next phrase (`เย็นนี้`, `ครึ่งวัน`), and `อีกสิบนาที` before the hour are not minutes. |
| `leavesNonTimesAlone` | Spending (`ทุ่มหนึ่งล้านบาท`), effort (`ทุ่มเท`), lengths of time (`สองชั่วโมงครึ่ง`), meals (`มื้อเที่ยง`), and `ซื้อนาฬิกา` are not touched. |
| `timeSurvivesPunctuationRemoval` | A clock time keeps its colon when punctuation is removed. |

### GlossaryMatcherTests.swift — exact normalized alias matching

| `vocabularyHintsIncludeLatinSpellings` | The English spellings in the glossary are sent to speech engines as hints. |

### SoundAlikeTests.swift — "high-confidence phonetic match confirmed by the user"

| Test | What it checks |
| --- | --- |
| `variantSpellingsShareASoundKey` | Five pairs of Thai spellings of the same English word sound the same (e.g. ไซต์โปรเจกต์ / ไซด์โปรเจ็กต์, คอมมิต / คอมมิท). |
| `differentWordsHaveDifferentKeys` | Different words do not. |
| `soundAlikeIsSuggestedButTextIsUnchanged` | A sound-alike spelling becomes a suggestion; the text is not changed. |

| `exactAliasWinsOverSoundAlike` | An exact alias is replaced directly, with no extra suggestion. |
| `unrelatedThaiIsLeftAlone` | Normal Thai sentences get no suggestions. |
| `shortAliasesNeverSoundAlike` | Short aliases (fewer than four sounds) are never used for sound-alikes. |
| `canBeTurnedOff` | The setting turns sound-alike suggestions off. |
| `disabledEntriesDoNotSoundAlike` | "Off" entries do not produce sound-alikes. |
| `silentLettersAreKeptWithTheWord` | The silent ต์ at the end is part of the suggestion, so no stray mark is left behind. |
| `acceptingASoundAlikeTeachesTheAlias` | In the full flow, tapping **Use** applies it and saves the new spelling as an alias. |

### LearnerTests.swift — learning from corrections

| Test | What it checks |

| `ignoresWholeSentenceRewrites` | Rewriting the whole sentence is not treated as vocabulary. |
| `ignoresPureInsertionsAndDeletions` | Adding or removing words teaches nothing. |
| `identicalTextTeachesNothing` | No change, no suggestion. |
| `suggestionKeyIgnoresCaseOfAlias` | "Side Project" and "side project" count as the same repeated correction. |
| `knownRulesAreRecognized` | A rule that already exists is recognized, so it is not offered again. |
| `diffHunksAreWordAligned` | The diff grows changes to whole Thai words. |
| `countsChangedWords` | Word counts for the correction-rate metric are right. |

### DictationFlowTests.swift — the whole pipeline with fake parts

A fake microphone, a fixed transcript, and a fake inserter stand in for the real ones.

| Test | What it checks |

| `escapeWhileListeningCancelsWithoutTranscribing` | Esc while listening stops everything; nothing is inserted or saved. |
| `quickTapStartsHandsFreeAndSecondPressFinishes` | A quick tap starts hands-free mode; the next press finishes and inserts. |
| `quickTapWithoutHandsFreeAsksToHoldLonger` | With hands-free off, a quick tap asks you to hold longer. |
| `silenceIsNotSentToTheRecognizer` | A silent recording is not transcribed (engines invent text from silence). |
| `microphoneDeniedShowsNotice` | No microphone permission shows a clear notice. |
| `transcriptionErrorShowsNotice` | A bad API key shows a clear notice. |
| `perAppStyleCanForceReview` | An app set to "not right away" always gets the review card. |
| `perAppPunctuationIsApplied` | An app's punctuation choice is used. |

| --- | --- |
| `bundledSetHasUniqueItemsInEveryCategory` | 56 sentences, unique ids, every category present. |

### OpenAIRequestTests.swift

| Test | What it checks |
| --- | --- |
| `buildsMultipartRequestForGPT4oTranscribe` | The request has the right URL, key header, model, language hint, confidence request, spelling hints, and file. |
| `whisperModelsUseVerboseJSONAndExamplePrompt` | Whisper models get segment timings and a mixed Thai-English example prompt. |

| `customEndpointIsUsed` | Other OpenAI-compatible services (e.g. Groq) work. |
| `parsesJSONWithLogprobs` | Confidence is computed from token probabilities. |
| `parsesVerboseJSONSegments` | Confidence is computed from Whisper segments. |
| `plainJSONHasNoConfidence` | No probabilities → no confidence (never a made-up number). |
